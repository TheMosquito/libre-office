# Libre Office User Files Directory

Optionally put your Libre Office config files here.

This directory is mapped to path `/config` inside the Libre Office container.

Libre Office will store user configurations and documents in this directory.

This directory can be mapped into other containers to provide other services (like file encryption and cloud backup).
